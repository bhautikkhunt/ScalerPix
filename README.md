You can directly download this software from my Google Drive link and can use it without any library installed in any PC.

And i am also providing Python code with GUI which is developed using Tkinter and you can use this code after downloading models for upscaling.

We used EDSR models for upscaling upto 4x so we have basically 3 models for 2x,3x and 4x.
